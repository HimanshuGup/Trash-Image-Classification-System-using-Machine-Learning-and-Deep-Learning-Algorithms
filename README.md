        Topic:   Trash Image Classication System using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms


In today's fast pacing world of the internet age with all the amenities and
latest gadgets, the major urban cities in the world are still struggling with trash
management. Only a few countries using the recycling of wastes but most of them
dumping all the trash to the landfills. The quantity of generated trash in day to
day life is aecting land, water, and air which causes a serious threat to the aquatic
species and their surroundings and ultimately to humans if not managed properly.
The objective of this study is to develop a system that can classify these trash
images into their correct categories with the help of machine learning and deep
learning methodologies. The dataset used for achieving this objective is released by
the TACO dataset consist of 1500 images of litter and trash with annotations and
labeled. There are ve categories of trash with the name 'Plastic straw', 'Drink
can ', Cigarette', and 'Clear plastic bottle' considered for this work. This dataset
is recently released and very rarely used in any research work. To make the dataset
more scalable and balanced various data augmentation techniques will be adopted.
Four classication algorithms such as the Sequential Keras model, transfer learning
ResNet-50, and VGG-19 models and XGBoost classier model will be developed for
features extraction and classication of images. The performance of the model will
be evaluated based on accuracy and comprehensive comparison will occur among
all the four models on several parameters. The outcomes showed that pre-trained
transfer learning models can be used for high classication accuracy and assured
that data augmentation techniques assists in improving the overall results.
